						<h2>3. WORD OF GOD</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Luke 24: 36-49</	br>
While they were still speaking about this, he stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace 
be with you.” But they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost. 
Then he said to them, “Why are you troubled? And why do questions arise in your hearts? 
Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a ghost does 
not have flesh and bones as you can see I have.” And as he said this, he showed them his 
hands and his feet. While they were still incredulous for joy and were amazed, he asked 
them, “Have you anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of baked fish; he took it and ate it in front of them. He said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while 
I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and in the 
prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the 
scriptures. And he said to them, “Thus it is written that the Messiah would suffer and 
rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance, for the forgiveness of sins, 
would be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning form Jerusalem. You are 
witnesses of these things. And (behold) I am sending the promise of my Father upon 
you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”</p>

						<h2>ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY SIRIT</h2></header>
 <p>On my knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses, I offer myself soul and 
body to You, Eternal Spirit of God. I adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. 
You are the Strength and Light of my soul. In You I live and move and am. 
I desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace, and I pray with all my heart to 
be kept from the smallest sin against You. Mercifully guard my every thought and grant 
that I may always watch for Your light and listen to Your voice and follow Your gracious 
inspirations. I cling to You and give myself to You and ask You by Your compassion to 
watch over me in my weakness.</br></br> 
Holding the pierced Feet of Jesus and looking at His Five Wounds and trusting in His 
Precious Blood and adoring His opened Side and stricken Heart, 
implore You Adorable Spirit, helper of my infirmity, so to keep me in Your grace that I 
may never sin against You. Give me grace O Holy host, Spirit of the Father and the Son, 
to say to You always and everywhere, “Speak Lord, for Your servant heareth”. Amen.</p>

						<h2>RECOMMITMENT PRAYER</h2></header>
 <p>Father God, I praise, thank and adore you for your gift of life and love. My heart fills 
with gratitude as I remember my past. I joyfully accept my present life and look 
to the future with hope. I thank you that I am your child. Thank you Father for the 
love and care that I experience through the beautiful fellowship of my brothers and 
sisters in the Jesus Youth movement.</br></br>
Lord Jesus, I desire to commit myself to you once again. I renounce all the powers 
of darkness and accept you as the Lord and Saviour of my life. O Risen Lord, I thank 
you for helping me through this movement to place myself and everything I have 
at your service. I surrender my life completely to you. Jesus, you are all I need. Heal 
my past, bless my present and take control of my future.</br></br> 
Holy Spirit, I thank you for your guidance in every moment of my life. Thank you, 
O divine Helper, for your constant presence within me. Intensify my thirst for you. 
May I have a deep personal relationship with you. Help me on this day of Pentecost 
to seek the Kingdom of God with greater eagerness and dedication. Bless me 
with all your gifts, fruits and charisms so that I may grow steadily in holiness and 
effectively live out my missionary call.</br></br>
Holy Trinity one God, I recommit myself to you, together with all the Jesus Youth 
of the world. Look with favour on our movement Lord. Guide us in our endeavours 
and protect us from all the snares of the enemy. Help us to use all the resources 
you have blessed us with for the growth of Your Kingdom and the greater glory 
of your name. Pour out your blessings on our Jesus Youth family and on all the 
people who support us in various ways. Grant that through the prayers of Mary, 
our Mother, we may always be a missionary movement at the service of the Church.
